 <h2>Kaylee's top 3 movies</h2>

 <hr />

 <h3>Spirited Away</h3>
 <p>I love Studio Ghibli movies. Spirited Away feels like a fever dream, and I mean that in a good way. It is one of those movies that I can 
    rewatch and with each rewatch, I think I enjoy it more and more. The music is amazing and nostalgic. The art is beautiful. yes.
 </p>

 <h3>Everything Everywhere All At Once</h3>
 <p>Oh man... this movie. It's super cool. This movie portrays how a person's life could turn out differently from 
    making different choices and happenings.. There is also the theory of multitudes of universes or versions of yourself. 
    I laughed and cried watching this. This movie reminds you to be appreciative for the life you have and the people in it.

 <h3>Crazy Rich Asians</h3>
 <p>This movie is not necessarily a "top 3," but I can't think of another movie to talk about. This movie has good laughs, sad sads, and sweet moments.</p>
